My favorite game!

Fizzbuzz is an exercise where the user must write a program to output all n
contained within the set of integers from 1..m where m is normally 100; however,
if the number is divisible by 3, instead of printing n, it prints `fizz`, if the
number is divisible by 5, it prints `buzz`, and if it is divisible by 15, it
prints `fizzbuzz`.

eg:

1
2
fizz
4
buzz
fizz
7
8
fizz
...
